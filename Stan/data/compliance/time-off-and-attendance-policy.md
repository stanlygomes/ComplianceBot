## Policy Statement

### Punctuality and Attendance

#### Regular Schedule

Employees are expected to arrive at work on time and adhere to their regular working schedule. Punctuality is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of the team and the organization as a whole. Persistent tardiness or unexcused absences may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

#### Flexibility

Wolfgang recognizes that employees may occasionally need to adjust their working hours due to personal commitments or unforeseen circumstances. Employees are encouraged to communicate any anticipated changes in their schedule to their manager in advance. Where possible, the company will accommodate reasonable requests for flexibility in working hours.

### Leave Entitlements

#### Annual Leave

Employees are entitled to a specified number of annual leave days per year, based on their length of service and employment contract. Annual leave should be planned in advance and approved by the employee's manager. Employees are encouraged to take their annual leave to maintain their well-being and prevent burnout.

#### Sick Leave

Employees who are unable to work due to illness or injury are entitled to take sick leave. Employees should notify their manager as soon as possible if they need to take sick leave and provide any necessary documentation, such as a medical certificate. Sick leave should be used for genuine illness or injury and not for other purposes.

#### Personal Leave

Employees may request personal leave for reasons such as family emergencies, bereavement, or other personal matters that require time off work. Personal leave requests should be made in advance, where possible, and approved by the employee's manager.

#### Public Holidays

Employees are entitled to public holidays as per the relevant laws and regulations of their country of residence. Where possible, employees should plan their workload around public holidays to ensure minimum disruption to business operations.

### Time-Off Requests

#### Advance Notice

Employees should request time off in advance by submitting a leave request through the company's designated system. The request should include the dates of absence, the reason for the time off, and any relevant details. Managers are responsible for approving or denying time-off requests in a timely manner.

#### Holidays and Peak Periods

During busy periods or holidays, employees may be required to prioritize work commitments and limit the number of staff taking time off simultaneously. In such cases, employees should be mindful of the impact of their absence on team performance and may be asked to reschedule their time-off requests.

#### Emergency Leave

In the event of an emergency that requires immediate time off, employees should notify their manager as soon as possible and provide an explanation for their absence. The company will assess emergency leave requests on a case-by-case basis and may require supporting documentation where applicable.

### Compliance and Reporting

#### Record Keeping

Employees are required to accurately record their time off in the company's HR system or any designated platform. Any discrepancies or inconsistencies in time-off records should be promptly reported to HR for clarification and resolution.
