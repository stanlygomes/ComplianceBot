Employees are expected to follow these guidelines when requesting financial approvals for expenses, investments, or any other financial transactions.

## Policy Statement

### Financial Approval Authority
1. All expenditure within the company must be approved in accordance with the delegated authority matrix. The matrix clearly outlines the level of approval required for different amounts of expenditure based on the employee's position within the company.
   
2. Employees are required to seek approval from the designated authority before incurring any expenses on behalf of the company. Any expenses incurred without prior approval will not be reimbursed by the company.

3. In the event that an employee needs to seek approval beyond their delegated authority, they must escalate the request to the appropriate hierarchy as defined in the organizational structure.

### Expense Approval Process
1. Employees are required to submit an expense report detailing all expenses incurred on behalf of the company. The expense report should be submitted within five business days of incurring the expense.

2. The expense report must be accompanied by original receipts or invoices for verification purposes. Failure to provide supporting documents may result in the rejection of the expense claim.

3. Managers are responsible for reviewing and approving expense reports submitted by their team members in a timely manner. Approval should be based on the adherence to company policies and the legitimacy of the expenses claimed.

### Investment Approval Process
1. Any investment proposals must be submitted to the designated investment committee for review and approval. The investment committee comprises members with expertise in finance, risk management, and strategic decision-making.

2. The investment proposal should include a detailed analysis of the potential investment, including financial projections, risk assessment, and strategic fit with the companyâ€™s objectives.

3. The investment committee will assess the proposal based on predefined criteria and make a decision on whether to approve or reject the investment. The decision-making process will be documented to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Compliance with Regulations
1. Employees are required to comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and company policies when seeking financial approvals. Any violations of regulatory requirements may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

2. Managers are responsible for ensuring that their team members are aware of and comply with the financial approval policy. Regular training and communication on policy updates should be conducted to promote awareness and understanding.

### Monitoring and Reporting
