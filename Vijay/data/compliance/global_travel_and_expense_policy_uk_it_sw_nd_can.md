# Wolfgang Global Travel and Expense Policy

## Policy Coverage

This Global Travel and Expense Policy applies to all employees of Wolfgang who are located in the Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Canada. The policy provides guidelines and procedures for expenses related to business travel and ensures that all employees are compliant with the company's standards for budget management and transparency. Employees are expected to adhere to this policy when incurring travel-related expenses and seeking reimbursement from the company.

## Policy Overview

Business travel can be an essential part of furthering Wolfgang's mission and objectives. However, it is also essential that employees adhere to responsible spending practices when traveling on behalf of the company. This policy aims to provide clarity and guidance on what expenses are eligible for reimbursement, the procedures for submitting expense reports, and the appropriate channels for approval.

## Policy Statement

### General Guidelines

1. **Pre-Trip Approval**: All business travel must be pre-approved by the employee's manager or department head. Any expenses incurred without prior authorization may not be reimbursed.

2. **Booking Procedures**: Employees should strive to book travel using Wolfgang's preferred travel partners to benefit from negotiated rates. Airfare, accommodation, and transportation arrangements should be made in advance when possible to minimize costs.

3. **Expense Categories**: Reimbursable expenses include airfare, accommodation, ground transportation, meals, and other business-related costs. Personal expenses and entertainment unrelated to business activities are not covered.

4. **Receipts and Documentation**: Employees must retain all original receipts and submit them along with their expense reports for any expenses incurred. Electronic receipts are acceptable if the original is not available.

### Netherlands Policy

1. **Accommodation**: Employees traveling within the Netherlands must seek accommodation options that are within the company's allocated budget. Luxury accommodations are not covered unless authorized by the employee's manager.

2. **Meals**: Meal expenses should be reasonable and in line with local norms. Employees are encouraged to explore local cuisine but should be mindful of the budget.

### Italy Policy

1. **Transportation**: Employees in Italy are encouraged to use public transportation where available to reduce expenses. Rental cars should be considered only when necessary and pre-approved.

2. **Miscellaneous Expenses**: Any additional expenses related to business activities must be justified and approved before being reimbursed.

### United Kingdom Policy

1. **Currency Conversion**: When submitting expenses incurred in a currency other than GBP, employees must use the exchange rate provided by the company's finance department.

2. **Compliance**: Employees in the UK must adhere to local tax laws and regulations when submitting expense reports to ensure compliance with financial reporting requirements.

### Switzerland Policy

1. **High-Cost Environment**: Given the high cost of living in Switzerland, employees are encouraged to seek cost-effective alternatives for accommodations and meals whenever possible.

2. **Approvals**: Expenses above a certain threshold require additional approval from the finance department due to the higher expenses typically incurred in Switzerland.

### Canada Policy

1. **Sales Tax**: Employees must ensure that all expenses include applicable taxes, such as GST and PST, when submitting expense reports for reimbursement.

2. **Incidental Expenses**: Employees may claim reasonable incidental expenses, such as tips and business-related calls, as part of their overall expense report.

## Conclusion

Adherence to the Wolfgang Global Travel and Expense Policy is essential for maintaining transparency, accountability, and financial stewardship. Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with the guidelines outlined in this policy and seek clarification from the Finance or HR department when in doubt. Failure to comply with this policy may result in delayed reimbursement or additional scrutiny of expenses. By following these guidelines, employees can contribute to the responsible management of company resources while fulfilling their business travel obligations effectively.
