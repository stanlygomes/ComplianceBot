      "\n",
      "## Policy Coverage\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy applies to all employees of [Company Name] who use personal devices for work-related purposes, including but not limited to smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices. It applies to employees working in all geographical locations where [Company Name] operates. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Policy Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "At [Company Name], we recognize the importance of allowing employees to use their personal devices for work-related tasks to enhance productivity, flexibility, and convenience. However, the use of personal devices at work also presents certain risks to the security and confidentiality of company information. Therefore, this policy aims to establish guidelines and best practices for employees to follow when using personal devices for work purposes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Employees are permitted to use personal devices for work-related tasks such as checking emails, participating in conference calls, accessing company documents, and using approved applications. However, personal devices should primarily be used for work purposes and should not be used for personal activities during working hours.\n",
      "\n",

      "- Not sharing devices or login credentials with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Data Protection\n",
      "\n",
